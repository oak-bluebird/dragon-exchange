            <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (the &ldquo;<strong>EEA</strong>&rdquo;), Dragon Corporation is the controller with respect to your personal information. We determine the means and purposes of processing data in relation to e-wallet and cryptocurrency transactions.</p>
            <p>Legal bases for processing personal information</p>
            <p>Our legal bases for processing under EEA Data Protection Law are described above in the sections entitled &ldquo;What do we use your personal information for?&rdquo;. We may process your personal information if you consent to the processing, to satisfy our legal obligations, if it is necessary to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you, or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you, or for our legitimate interests to protect our property, rights or safety of Dragon Corporation, our customers or others.</p>
            <p>Direct Marketing</p>
            <p>If you are a current customer residing in the EEA, we will only contact you by electronic means (email) with information about our services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.</p>
            <p>If you are a new customer and located in the EEA, we will contact you if you are located in the EU by electronic means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such communication. If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, or to pass your personal information on to third parties for marketing purposes, please contact us to opt-out immediately. You may raise such objection with regard to initial or further processing for purposes of direct marketing, at any time and free of charge. Direct marketing includes any communications to you that are only based on advertising or promoting products and services</p>
            <p>Individual Rights</p>
            <p>EEA residents have the following rights, which can be exercised by contacting us at&nbsp; <a href="mailto:privacy@drgx.io">privacy@drgx.io</a> so that we may consider your request under applicable law.</p>
            <p>All EEA users will have the following rights which can be exercised anytime by contacting us:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent.&nbsp;You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information collected on the basis of your consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of Dragon Corporation&rsquo;s processing based on consent before your withdrawal.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Right of access to and rectification of your personal information.&nbsp;You have a right to request that we provide you a copy of your personal information held by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to some fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. You may also request us to rectify or update any of your personal information held by Dragon Corporation that is inaccurate. Your right to access and rectification shall only be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Right to delete.&nbsp;You have the right to request deletion of your personal information that: (a) is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; (b) was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented, but later withdraw such consent; or (c) was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing. If we have made your personal information public and are obliged to delete the personal information, we will, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other parties that are processing your personal information that you have requested the deletion of any links to, or copy or replication of your personal information. The above is subject to limitations by relevant data protection laws.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Right to data portability.&nbsp;If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another &ldquo;controller&rdquo;, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. A &ldquo;controller&rdquo; is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Right to restriction of or processing.&nbsp;You have the right to restrict or object to us processing your personal information where one of the following applies:</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(a) You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. In such instances, we will restrict processing during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information.</p>
            <p>(b) The processing is unlawful and you oppose the deletion of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead.</p>
            <p>(c) We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
            <p>(d) You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Dragon Corporation&rsquo;s processing override your rights.</p>
            <p>Restricted personal information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if the restriction is lifted.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Notification of deletion rectification and restriction.&nbsp;We will communicate any rectification or deletion of your personal information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your personal information has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.</li>
            <li>Right to object to processing.&nbsp;Where the processing of your personal information is based on consent, contract or legitimate interests you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your personal information as permitted by applicable law. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</li>
            <li>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.&nbsp;You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.</li>
            <li>Right to lodge a complaint.&nbsp;If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to contact us first at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@drgx.io">privacy@drgx.io</a> so that we can try to resolve the issue or dispute informally. You can also complain about our processing of your personal information to the relevant data protection authority. You can complain in the EU member state where you live or work, or in the place where the alleged breach of data protection law has taken place. In the UK, the relevant data protection authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</li>
